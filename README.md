This repository is a portfolio site created by babylonjs that is completely represented in 3DCG Scene.

This includes the 3D models, which I created myself from scratch, the shaders, and the programs that control them.

This project is ongoing. Progress is published on [my blog](https://blog.udemegane.net/p/%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AA%E3%82%B5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88%E3%82%92%E4%BD%9C%E3%82%8B-%E3%81%9D%E3%81%AE1/) (japanese)
